Java:
Significance of Lambda:
It represents a clear and concise way of representing one method of interface using an expression.

how streams works 
They are wrappers around data source ,allowing us to operate with the data source and making bulk processing fast 
With streams source ->Filter -> Sort ->Map ->Collect.

how concurrency can be implemented in java8
To enable multithreading we can use Parallel Streams.
the parallelStream() method that runs operations over streams elements in parallel mode.

Feature related to memory management in java8:
The Jdk 8 JVM is using native memory for the representation of class metadata and is called as metaspace.
So no more java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen error and no need for us to tune and monitor the memory space 
This has removed the permgenSpace completely.

Password hashing:
hashing:inputs a value and transforms the vaue to another format which is unrecognizable
properties of hashing:
.Repeatable - reproducable for next time also 
.oneway - if we decrypt (dehash) can't get the same value

when a user logs in and provides the password then the value which is already hashed and stored in the db with that will be comparing and vaidates accordingly.
