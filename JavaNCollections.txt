OOPS Concepts:

Object - Any entity - properties and todo tasks
Class - blueprint of what object follows
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism





public static void Main()
public - access modifier and accessible by any class
static - can be accessed by JVM without creating any instance
void - will not return any values
main - JVM will search for it as a strting point

Platform independent - Java internally gets converted as byte code so that it can run on any system irrespective of OS

Java is not 100% object oriented because it makes use of primitive data types which are not objects

difference between == & equals ()
== this is used to compare two primitive types such as string and objects.
equals used to compare the values of two objects 

diff between stack and heap
stack is a memory which is used by one thread of an application whereas heap is a memory which is used by all parts of an application
